# 3D Marching Cubes For Implicit Surfaces

A continuation method to tessellate an algebraic surface. Grid resolution can 
be chosen by the user. Include adaptive grid refinements of ambiguous divisions, limit the 
refinement to ½ and ¼ of the starting grid resolution. Resolution changes one step at a time.
