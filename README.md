# 3D Marching Cubes For Implicit Surfaces

This project visualizes implicit surfaces from an input equation. The program uses 3D marching cubes, an algorithm for creating a polygonal surface representation of an algebraic surface of a 3D scalar field. 

This project is part of a course project for Computational Geometry CS531 at Purdue University.
